# Backend Main.py Updates for Chunk-Based Transcription History

## Summary of Changes Made

This document summarizes the changes made to `backend/main.py` to support the new chunk-based transcription history system.

## Key Changes

### 1. Updated Imports
- Added `Transcript_chunk` to the imports from `utils.states`
```python
from utils.states import History, Transcription, Transcript_chunk
```

### 2. Refactored Event Stream Callback Function

The main change was in the `/submit` endpoint's `event_stream()` function. The callback function was completely rewritten to:

#### Handle "transcribed" Events (New)
- Create `Transcript_chunk` objects from transcription events
- Extract all relevant metadata (session, offset, duration, text, speaker_id, result_id, filename, language)
- Append chunks to `transcription_record.transcript_chunks` list
- Log chunk addition with character count

#### Handle Legacy "transcript" Events (Backward Compatibility)
- Create a single chunk for legacy events that contain full text
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing transcription systems

#### Maintain Status Management
- Continue to handle "closing", "session_stopped", and "error" events
- Update transcription status appropriately

### 3. Event Structure Mapping

The callback now maps transcription events to `Transcript_chunk` dataclass fields:

| Event Field | Chunk Field | Description |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `event_type` | `event_type` | Type of transcription event |
| `session` | `session` | Session identifier |
| `offset` | `offset` | Timestamp offset in milliseconds |
| `duration` | `duration` | Duration of the chunk in milliseconds |
| `text` | `text` | Transcribed text content |
| `speaker_id` | `speaker_id` | Speaker identifier |
| `result_id` | `result_id` | Result identifier |
| `filename` | `filename` | Source audio filename |
| N/A | `language` | Language from transcription settings |

### 4. Enhanced Transcription Event Sources

Updated `backend/utils/transcription.py` to include language information in all transcribed events:

#### Microsoft Speech Services Events
```python
transcription_object = {
    "event_type": "transcribed",
    "session": evt.session_id,
    "offset": evt.offset,
    "duration": evt.result.duration,
    "text": evt.result.text,
    "speaker_id": evt.result.speaker_id,
    "result_id": evt.result.result_id,
    "filename": self.conversationfilename,
    "language": self.language,  # Added for consistency
}
```

### 5. History API Endpoints

All existing history API endpoints continue to work without changes:
- `/history/create`
- `/history/user/{user_id}`
- `/history/session/{session_id}`
- `/history/{history_id}`
- `/history/{history_id}/visibility`
- `/history`
- `/history/{history_id}/transcription/{transcription_index}/analysis`
- `/history/{history_id}/transcriptions`

FastAPI automatically handles dataclass serialization, so the new `transcript_chunks` structure is properly serialized in API responses.

### 6. Backward Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility by:
- Supporting both "transcribed" (new chunked) and "transcript" (legacy full text) events
- Handling existing transcription factories without modification
- Preserving all existing API endpoints and response formats

## Data Flow

1. **Transcription Event Generated**: Various transcription services (MSFT, LLM, Whisper) generate events
2. **Event Processing**: The callback function receives events and processes them based on type
3. **Chunk Creation**: For "transcribed" events, `Transcript_chunk` objects are created and added to the transcription
4. **History Storage**: Completed transcriptions with their chunks are stored in the history system
5. **API Serialization**: History endpoints return the chunk structure via FastAPI's automatic dataclass serialization

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Granular Transcript Access**: Individual chunks with timing and speaker information
2. **Enhanced Metadata**: Each chunk contains session, offset, duration, speaker, and language data
3. **Real-time Updates**: Chunks are added as they arrive during streaming transcription
4. **Improved UI Support**: Frontend can display chunks with timing and speaker information
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing systems continue to work unchanged
6. **Future Extensibility**: Chunk structure can be extended with additional metadata

## Testing

- Verified proper JSON serialization of all new data structures
- Confirmed that dataclass-to-dict conversion works correctly
- Tested that FastAPI properly serializes responses with chunk data
- Ensured no breaking changes to existing API endpoints

## Next Steps

The backend is now fully ready to:
1. Collect chunk-based transcription data during real transcription sessions
2. Store chunks with complete metadata in history records
3. Serve chunk data to the frontend via existing API endpoints
4. Support the enhanced frontend UI that displays chunk information

All changes maintain full backward compatibility while adding the new chunk-based functionality.
