# Audio Splitting Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Silence-Based Audio Splitting** (`split_wav_by_silence`)
- **Energy-based detection**: Analyzes audio energy to identify silence periods
- **Configurable parameters**: 
  - `min_silence_length`: Minimum silence duration for splitting
  - `silence_threshold`: Energy threshold for silence detection
  - `step_duration`: Processing accuracy vs speed control
- **Smart boundary detection**: Uses rising edges to find optimal split points

### 2. **Time-Based Audio Splitting** (`split_wav_by_time`)
- **Fixed-duration chunks**: Split audio into equal time segments
- **Overlap support**: Optional overlap between chunks for continuity
- **Intelligent boundary handling**: Last chunk includes remaining audio
- **Configurable parameters**:
  - `chunk_duration`: Size of each time chunk
  - `overlap`: Overlap duration between chunks

### 3. **Convenience Functions**
- `quick_split_audio()`: Simplified silence-based splitting
- `quick_split_by_time()`: Simplified time-based splitting

### 4. **Command-Line Interface**
```bash
# Silence-based splitting
python utils/audio.py split audio.wav [--options]

# Time-based splitting  
python utils/audio.py split_time audio.wav [--options]
```

### 5. **Common Features**
- **Automatic output management**: Files saved to `data/split/` directory
- **Progress tracking**: Visual progress bars with tqdm
- **Dry-run support**: Test without creating files
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error checking and reporting
- **File naming**: Clear naming conventions with indices

## 📁 File Structure

```
backend/
├── utils/
│   └── audio.py                 # Main audio utilities with splitting functions
├── data/
│   └── split/                   # Output directory for split files
├── test_audio_split.py          # Test script for both splitting methods
├── README_audio_splitting.md    # Comprehensive documentation
└── pyproject.toml              # Updated with required dependencies
```

## 🔧 Dependencies Added

- `tqdm==4.67.1`: Progress bars
- `scipy==1.15.3`: Audio file I/O (already present)
- `numpy`: Numerical operations (included with scipy)

## 📊 Output File Naming

- **Silence-based**: `{original_name}_{index:03d}.wav`
  - Example: `meeting_001.wav`, `meeting_002.wav`
- **Time-based**: `{original_name}_time_{index:03d}.wav` 
  - Example: `meeting_time_001.wav`, `meeting_time_002.wav`

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ✅ Functional Tests
- **Silence detection**: Successfully detects and splits at silence periods
- **Time chunking**: Accurately splits into fixed-duration segments
- **Overlap handling**: Properly implements overlapping chunks
- **Dry-run mode**: Correctly simulates without creating files
- **Command-line interface**: All CLI options working correctly
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases

### ✅ Real Audio Tests
- Successfully split conversation audio into 16 segments (silence-based)
- Successfully split 20-second audio into 4 × 5-second chunks (time-based)
- Proper handling of files shorter than chunk duration
- Correct overlap implementation

## 💡 Use Cases

### Silence-Based Splitting
- Meeting recordings with natural conversation breaks
- Lecture recordings with topic transitions
- Interview recordings with speaker changes
- Podcast episodes with segment breaks

### Time-Based Splitting
- Batch processing of large audio files
- Consistent chunks for transcription APIs
- Uniform segments for ML model training
- Storage optimization with fixed file sizes

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Python Code
```python
# Silence-based splitting
from utils.audio import split_wav_by_silence
result = split_wav_by_silence('meeting.wav', min_silence_length=2.0)

# Time-based splitting with overlap
from utils.audio import split_wav_by_time
result = split_wav_by_time('audio.wav', chunk_duration=30.0, overlap=2.0)
```

### Command Line
```bash
# Split by silence (2+ seconds of silence)
python utils/audio.py split meeting.wav --min-silence-length 2.0

# Split into 10-second chunks with 1-second overlap
python utils/audio.py split_time audio.wav --chunk-duration 10.0 --overlap 1.0
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Two complementary splitting approaches
2. **Production-ready**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
3. **User-friendly**: Both programmatic and CLI interfaces
4. **Efficient**: Progress tracking and optimized processing
5. **Configurable**: Extensive parameter customization
6. **Well-documented**: Complete usage guide and examples

The implementation provides a robust, flexible solution for audio splitting that can handle various use cases in your meeting STT application! 🎵✂️
