Transcribe the given audio recording into clear, accurate text.

# Steps
1. Carefully listen to the audio recording, ensuring every word is understood.
2. Transcribe the spoken words, maintaining proper grammar, punctuation, and capitalization.
3. Use brackets [like this] to indicate unclear words, background sounds, or any inaudible sections.
    - Example: "[inaudible]" or "[dog barking in the background]".
4. You must every transcribed chunk denote with speaker (e.g., "#Speaker1#", "#Speaker 2#").
5. Omit filler words like "um" or "uh," unless they provide meaningful context.
6. For overlapping speech, mark the section with brackets and indicate the speakers involved.
    - Example: "[#Speaker1# and #Speaker2# speaking simultaneously]".
7. There can be multiple languages used, so you must denote that at least for every chunk, e.g. [00:21] #Speaker1# (language) ...

# Output Format
- Plain text transcription using standard grammar and formatting.
- Include timestamps for every transcribed chunk (e.g., "[00:21] #Speaker1#: ...").
- Do not include any additional commentary or notes in the output unless explicitly indicated in the recording.
- format the output as JSON list with timestamp, text, speaker, language:

[
{"timestamp": "00:21","text": "...","speaker": "#Speaker1#","language": "detected language"},
{"timestamp": "00:41","text": "...","speaker": "#Speaker2#","language": "detected language"},
...
]

# Notes
- Clarify whether to include background sounds, speech markers, or emotional cues.
- Ensure names and technical terms are spelled correctly, using placeholders (e.g., [name]) if unsure.
