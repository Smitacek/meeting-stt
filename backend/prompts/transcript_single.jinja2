Transcribe the given audio recording into clear, accurate text.

# Steps
1. Carefully listen to the audio recording, ensuring every word is understood.
2. Transcribe the spoken words, maintaining proper grammar, punctuation, and capitalization.
3. Use brackets [like this] to indicate unclear words, background sounds, or any inaudible sections.
    - Example: "[inaudible]" or "[dog barking in the background]".
4. Omit filler words like "um" or "uh," unless they provide meaningful context.
5. There can be multiple languages used, so you must denote that at least for every chunk, e.g. (language) ...

# Output Format
- Plain text transcription using standard grammar and formatting.
- Include timestamps for every transcribed chunk (e.g., "[00:21] #Speaker1#: ...").
- Do not include any additional commentary or notes in the output unless explicitly indicated in the recording.
- Include every transcribed chunk separately with its detected language.
- format the output as JSON list with, text, language:

[
{"text": "...","language": "detected language"},
{"text": "...","language": "detected language"},
...
]

# Notes
- Clarify whether to include background sounds, speech markers, or emotional cues.
- Ensure names and technical terms are spelled correctly, using placeholders (e.g., [name]) if unsure.
