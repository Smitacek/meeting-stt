# Working locally  

There are two parts to this project: the backend and the frontend. The backend is written in Python, and the frontend is written in JavaScript using React.

## Backend

```bash  
cd backend  
```
Set up a virtual environment (Preferred)
```bash
uv venv
```
Once youâ€™ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.

On Windows, run:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
On Unix or MacOS, run:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
To deactivate :
```bash
deactivate
```
> More information about virtual environments can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

### Install dependencies

uv sync
```

### Run
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Frontend (open a new terminal)
```bash
cd frontend
```
### Install dependencies
